# 🧠 Text Classification with Logistic Regression

This project implements a basic **text classification pipeline** using **TF-IDF Vectorization** and **Logistic Regression** to predict labels based on textual data. The model achieves an impressive **accuracy score of 97%**, indicating strong performance on the given dataset.

---

## 🔍 Features

- **TF-IDF Vectorization** for converting raw text into numerical features
- **Logistic Regression** for classification
- **Train-Test Split** to validate performance
- Achieved **97% accuracy**

---

## 📦 Libraries Used

- `numpy`
- `pandas`
- `scikit-learn`

---

## 🧪 How it Works

1. Load and preprocess the dataset
2. Transform text data using `TfidfVectorizer`
3. Train a `LogisticRegression` classifier
4. Evaluate using `accuracy_score`
